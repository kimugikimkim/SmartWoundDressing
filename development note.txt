	1.2 if any 12C communication not available blink in . 
3. if CCS811 Co2 and TVOC show 400,0 then output that the C02 and/or TVOC is lower than detectable offset												...... status OK
4. as you can see that when we disconnecct the smartwound sensor, and then we reconnect. only sht31 available. we need to make every sensors			...... status NOK
in smartwound sensor available when we reconnect
