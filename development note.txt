the version of this program has 5 stages
1. i2c connection
2. TCS34725 (Color Sensor)
3. SHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor) 
4. CCS811 (CO2 and Volatile Organic Compounds detection)
5. Data logger

version 1
1. beable to initialize all the sensors, be stable and data logging

Version 2
1. each position of blink is telling the user about communacation status 																				...... status:: need to be checked
	1.1 if all I2C communication are available notify user by blinking internal LED in --- but if all is not available blink in ...						...... status:: need to be checked
	1.2 if any 12C communication not available blink in . 																								...... status:: need to be checked
3. if CCS811 Co2 and TVOC show 400,0 then output that the C02 and/or TVOC is lower than detectable offset												...... status OK
4. as you can see that when we disconnecct the smartwound sensor, and then we reconnect. only sht31 available. we need to make every sensors			...... status:: need to checked
in smartwound sensor available when we reconnect
5. auto integration time may not work.. we will use manual callibrate instead 																			...... status OK

Version 2 patch 1
6. re-initialize the sensors when it reconnect to the device																							...... status OK
7. calculate the mean value of 50 sampling and use this value to represent the 																			...... status OK
